### Equations solved

There is the possibility of solving:

#### Linear scalar transport

To run this model, we must define:

```c
#define EQUATION_SYSTEM 0 
```

and the following equation is solved:

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + v_x\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+ v_y\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+ v_z\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}= 0 $$

where $v_x$, $v_y$ and $v_z$ the are x, y and z velocities.

#### Burgers equation

To run this model, we must define:

```c
#define EQUATION_SYSTEM 1 
```

and the following equation is solved:

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+ u\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+ u\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}=0 $$

#### Euler equations:
To run this model, we must define:

```c
#define EQUATION_SYSTEM 2 
```

and the following system of equations is solved:

$$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0 \quad\hbox{Continuity}$$

$$\frac{\partial (\rho \mathbf{v})}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left(\rho \mathbf{v} \otimes \mathbf{v} + p \mathbf{I}\right) = \rho \mathbf{g} \quad\hbox{Momentum}$$

$$\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left((E + p) \mathbf{v}\right) = \rho \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{g} \quad\hbox{Energy}$$



where $\rho$ is density, $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity vector, $p$ is pressure and $\mathbf{g}=(0,0,g)^T$ is the gravitational acceleration vector. The energy is defined as  the sum of kinetic and internal energy

$$E=\rho(\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{v}^2+e)$$

One should note the relations $p=(\gamma-1)\rho e\equiv (\gamma-1)(E-\frac{1}{2}\rho\mathbf{v})$.

- When setting ```#define ST 0```, we assume $g=0$. 

- When setting  ```#define ST 1```, we consider non-zero gravity and need to use the solver HLLS. 

- When setting  ```#define ST 2```, we consider non-zero gravity and need to use the solver HLL in fluctuation version. 

- When setting ```#define ST 3```  we consider non-zero gravity and need to use the solver HLL in fluctuation version. Besides,the equation for the conservation of energy is solved in fully conservative form, defining energy as $E_T=\rho(\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{v}+e+gz)$, yielding to

$$\begin{align}
\frac{\partial E_T}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \left((E_T + p) \mathbf{v}\right) &= 0 
\end{align}$$


It is possible to run the two-component Euler equations, setting:
```c
#define MULTICOMPONENT 1
```
and set ```MULTI_TYPE=1``` to choose this Gamma formulation  $\phi =\gamma$ or  ```MULTI_TYPE=2``` to use this formulation $\phi =1/(\gamma-1)$  (see R. Abgrall, S. Karni, Computations of Compressible Multifluids, JCP 169 (2001)) for

$$\frac{\partial \rho\phi}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial \rho u\phi}{\partial x}=0$$


### Input data

Inside the **case/** directory we will find all files corresponding to the simulation case, we need as input files:

- **configure.input**: Input configuration file for running a case, that includes the global configuration and is of the following form:

```
/////SIMULATION_SETUP//////

u_z                     1.0
```

- **initial.out**: Input file for initial conditions, that is of the following form (for scalar and Euler equations respectively):
```

CELLS = 40, 40, 40,
0.0075 0.0075 0.0075 0.0 
0.0075 0.0075 0.0225 0.0
0.0075 0.0075 0.0375 0.0 
...
```
 
``` 
VARIABLES = X, Y, Z, u, v, w, rho, p, phi 
CELLS = 40, 40, 40,
0.0075 0.0075 0.0075 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0
0.0075 0.0075 0.0225 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0
0.0075 0.0075 0.0375 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0
...
 ```
The initial conditions can also be set in, when setting ```READ_INITIAL = 0```:
```c 
int update_initial(t_mesh *mesh);
```

- **equilibrium.out**: Input file for equilibrium state (only when considering atmospheric cases). Similar structure than above.


- **solid_cells.input**: Input file for the definition of solid cells (`0` if solid) if `#define ALLOW_SOLIDS 2`
``` 
VARIABLES = X, Y, Z, sld

0.0075 0.0075 0.0075 0 
0.0075 0.0075 0.0225 1
0.0075 0.0075 0.0375 0
...
```

### Output data

This software allows printing data in *.vtk format and ASCII *.out files. To activate each of those output file types, use the macros:

```c
#define WRITE_VTK 1  //print *.vtk
#define WRITE_LIST 1 //print ASCII *.out
```

For *.vkt files, it is posible to choose the variables to print by means of additional macros. For instance, if we want to print X,Y,Z momentum and pressure, do:
```c
#define print_RHO 0
#define print_MOMENTUM 1
#define print_ENERGY 0
#define print_PRESSURE 1
#define print_OVERPRESSURE 0
#define print_SOLUTES 0
#define print_POTENTIALTEM 0
```

The time lapse for writing files is set as *DumpTime* in the file *configure.input*. 

### The computational mesh

The computational mesh is Cartesian and is constructed as follows:

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="../doc/grid.png" width="60%" alt="my alt text"/>
</figure>

with cell numbers in green, wall numbers in red and node numbers in blue.

Each reference element (volume cell) is defined as follows:

<figure style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="../doc/cell.png" width="30%" alt="my alt text"/>
</figure>

with wall numbers in red and node numbers in blue. These are defined in the corresponding data structures in *structures.h* (see [the API documentation](docAPI.md)).

### Boundary conditions

The available boundary conditions are:

* 1: Periodic
* 2: User defined
* 3: Transmissive (Euler). The numerical flux is set as the physical flux at the interface.
* 4: Solid wall (Euler). Defined as a slip boundary condition which is based on the HLL flux.

They are set by using the numbers above in the configuration file **configure.input**.

### Spatial reconstructions

Spatial reconstructions are implemented using 1D splitting. The available reconstructions are:

- Linear 3, 5 and 7
- WENO 3, 5 and 7
- TENO 3, 5 and 7

To select the spatial reconstruction method, use:
 ```c
#define TYPE_REC 0 //This is 0 for WENO, 1 for TENO and 2 for UWC
```

Note that **only orders 1, 3, 5 and 7 are available**.

### Time integrator

The time stepping is done using a Strong Stability Preserving Runge-Kutta 3 (SSPRK3) method when the spatial order is greater than 1, or with a 1-st order explicit Euler method, when the spatial order is 1.

### Riemann solvers

For the **linear scalar equation**, we use an upwind flux definition.

For the **Burgers equation**, we also use an upwind flux definition.

For **Euler equations**, the available solvers are:
- HLL solver
- HLLS solver
- HLLC solver

and can be configured as follows:
```c
#define SOLVER 0 //0: HLL solver, 1: HLLC solver, 2: HLLS solver
```
